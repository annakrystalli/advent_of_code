## Session information

<!-- Insert the session information into the document -->
```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```


## Brief

<!-- Insert Part 1 of the puzzle brief here -->

You receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with jump instructions, it would like you to compute the result of a series of unusual register instructions.

Each instruction consists of several parts: the **register to modify**, whether to **increase or decrease that register's value**, the **amount by which to increase or decrease it**, and a **condition**. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:

```
b inc 5 if a > 1
a inc 1 if b < 5
c dec -10 if a >= 1
c inc -20 if c == 10
```
These instructions would be processed as follows:

Because a starts at 0, it is not greater than 1, and so b is not modified.
a is increased by 1 (to 1) because b is less than 5 (it is 0).
c is decreased by -10 (to 10) because a is now greater than or equal to 1 (it is 1).
c is increased by -20 (to -10) because c is equal to 10.
After this process, the largest value in any register is 1.

You might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal to). However, the CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.

**What is the largest value in any register after completing the instructions in your puzzle input?**



# Let's go

### Packages & functions
```{r, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)
library(aocodeR)
```


## Input

<!-- Supply day. cookie_path defaults to path in my project -->
```{r}
input <- aoc_get_input(day = 8, cookie_path = paste0(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(),
                                                 "/secrets/session_cookie.txt"))
```

## Functions
### Turn input into tibble and then mutate to R expression string


```{r}
expressify_input <- function(input) {
    input %>% 
        strsplit("\n") %>% unlist %>% 
        map(~{strsplit(., " ") %>% 
                unlist  %>% 
                setNames(c("reg", "s", "n", "cond", "cond_reg", "cond_cnd", "cond_n"))}) %>%
        do.call("bind_rows", .)  %>% 
        mutate(s = recode(s, "inc" = "+","dec" = "-"),
               cmd = paste(cond,"(", paste0("e$",cond_reg), cond_cnd, cond_n, ")",
                           paste0("e$",reg), "<-", paste0("e$",reg), s, n,";"))
}

```



### Evaluate the expressions into a separate environments and return required maximum


```{r}
eval_input_df <- function(input, out_max = F) {
    max.e <- 0
    e <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
    
    # assign registers to environment e
    input %>% select(reg, cond_reg) %>% unlist %>% unique %>%
        lapply(FUN = function(x){assign(x, 0, envir = e)})
    
    for(i in 1:nrow(input)){
        eval(parse(text = input$cmd[i]))
        max.e <- max(max.e, mget(ls(e), envir = e) %>% unlist %>% max, envir = max.e)
    }
    if(out_max){max.e}else{
        mget(ls(e), envir = e) %>% unlist %>% max}
}
```


## Test
```{r}
test_input <- "b inc 5 if a > 1\na inc 1 if b < 5\nc dec -10 if a >= 1\nc inc -20 if c == 10" %>%
    expressify_input()

expect_equal(eval_input_df(test_input), 1)
```

## deploy

```{r}

expressify_input(input) %>% eval_input_df()

```
```{r}
system.time(expressify_input(input) %>% eval_input_df())
```


## Success!

# ---- Part 2 ----


## Brief
<!-- Insert Part 2 of the puzzle brief here -->

To be safe, the CPU also needs to know **the highest value held in any register during this process** so that it can decide how much memory to allocate to these operations. For example, in the above instructions, the highest value ever held was 10 (in register c after the third instruction was evaluated).

# Let's go

## Test
```{r}
expect_equal(eval_input_df(test_input, out_max = T), 10)
```

## deploy

```{r}
expressify_input(input) %>% eval_input_df(out_max = T)
```

## Success!

### What the functions do:
```{r}
expressify_input(input) 
```




## Endnote

I really liked today's. It got me practicing with working with environments and `eval`. It also prompted some useful discussions in the office about the dangers in `eval`, summarised in this xkcd (HT [\@acceleratedsci](https://twitter.com/acceleratedsci))
