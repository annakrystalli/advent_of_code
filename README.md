### Welcome to my  **Advent of C0de 2017** adventures! 
You can follow my progress here. I'll be producing a vignette and sharing it for any puzzles I complete and will primarily be working in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) (❤️ [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=tyah)). Feel free to share suggestions or your own solutions throught the gitter channel!


About:
> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. Learn more [here](https://adventofcode.com/2017/about)
